# V3 — Implementation Plan

## Phase 1 — Multi-album schema (MA) ✅

Biggest breaking change: reverses IMP-5 and restores a many-to-many relationship between photos and albums.

### Migration (v4.sql)
- Add `album_photos (album_id INTEGER REFERENCES albums(id) ON DELETE CASCADE, photo_id INTEGER REFERENCES photos(id) ON DELETE CASCADE, PRIMARY KEY (album_id, photo_id))`
- Migrate existing data: `INSERT INTO album_photos SELECT album_id, id FROM photos WHERE album_id IS NOT NULL`
- Drop `album_id` column from `photos`

### Routes to update
Every route that reads or writes `p.album_id` must be rewritten to use the join table:
- `GET /photos` — join `album_photos` for album filter
- `GET /albums/:id` — `JOIN album_photos ap ON ap.album_id = $1 JOIN photos p ON p.id = ap.photo_id`
- `POST /albums/:id/photos` — insert into `album_photos`, no longer sets `album_id`
- `DELETE /albums/:id/photos` — delete from `album_photos`
- `GET /timeline` — album filter via `album_photos` join
- `GET /map` — album filter via `album_photos` join
- All viewer-scoped queries — `album_access` join goes through `album_photos`
- Photo edit form (`GET/POST /photos/:id/edit`) — add multi-album membership UI (MA-3)
- Photo detail page (`GET /photos/:id`) — show album list (MA-2)

### Key decisions
- A photo with zero album memberships is a standalone photo (same semantics as before)
- Removing from an album never deletes the photo
- Viewer access: a viewer sees a photo if they have access to **at least one** album the photo belongs to

## Phase 2 — Album UX + Recipe album (ALB + RA) ✅

These are independent of each other but both depend on Phase 1 completing first.

### ALB-1 — Click-to-edit / lightbox button in album ✅
- ✅ Editor/admin: thumbnail click → `/photos/:id/edit?from=/albums/:id`; ⛶ hover button → lightbox
- ✅ Viewer: thumbnail click → lightbox (unchanged)
- ✅ Role check server-side; lightbox script shared via `lbOverlay()` + `lbScript()`

### RA-1 — Snapshot album from recipe ✅
- ✅ 📁 button on every recipe row in the combinator sidebar (hover to reveal)
- ✅ `POST /api/recipes/:id/album` — `requireEditor` + `wrapAsync`; guards empty-filter recipes (422); bulk-inserts into `album_photos`; redirects to new album
- ✅ Empty-filter guard prevents full-table scan; recipes with filters but no matching photos create an empty album

---

## Phase 3 — Design refresh (DS-11, DS-12, DS-13)

These three are fully independent and can be worked in parallel.

### DS-11 — Travel pages
- Redesign `/travels`, `/travels/:id`, `/travels/new`, `/travels/:id/edit`
- New interactions: click map pin → photo panel; click GPX trace segment → date/time tooltip; inline link/unlink of albums and photos without page reload (fetch + DOM update)

### DS-12 — Tag combinator
- Visual consistency pass: spacing, typography, chip design aligned with app design system
- New interactions: inline tag creation (type → "Create tag X" appears in dropdown); drag-to-reorder recipe sections; mobile layout improvements

### DS-13 — Photo selection
- Rubber-band drag-select on photo grids (mousedown → mousemove → mouseup)
- Shift+click for range select; Cmd/Ctrl+click for toggle
- Visible selection count badge; floating action bar appears when ≥ 1 photo selected

---

## Phase 4 — Local AI (AI)

Both features require Ollama running locally with a vision-capable model (e.g. `llava`, `moondream`, or `llava-phi3`). Node calls `http://localhost:11434/api/generate` with the image encoded as base64.

### AI-1 — Duplicate detection
- Admin panel: "Scan for duplicates" button → `POST /admin/ai/duplicates`
- Step 1: compute perceptual hash (pHash) for every photo using `sharp` — fast, no model needed
- Step 2: group photos whose pHash distance < threshold (near-duplicates)
- Step 3: for uncertain pairs (threshold border), call Ollama to confirm similarity
- Results page: groups of similar photos, each with thumbnails and a "Delete" / "Keep all" action
- Store scan results in a session or temp table; rescan clears previous results

### AI-2 — People identification
- On photo detail or album detail: "Identify people" button per photo (or batch via selection)
- `POST /api/ai/identify-people` — accepts `{ photoIds }`
- For each photo: encode image as base64, send to Ollama with a prompt listing existing people tags: "Who is in this photo? Known people: [Alice, Bob, …]. Answer with names from the list or describe if unknown."
- Response parsed to extract name mentions → matched against existing `people`-category tags
- UI: suggestion chips ("Alice? ✓ ✗", "Unknown person — create tag?") the user confirms or dismisses
- Confirmed tags are inserted into `photo_tags`

### Ollama integration notes
- Wrap Ollama calls in a helper `src/ollama.js` with a timeout and a clear error when Ollama is unreachable
- Vision model must be pulled before use: `ollama pull llava` (document in README)
- Processing is sequential to avoid overloading the local GPU/CPU; show progress to the user

## Phase 5 — Technical Quality Backlog (TQ)

Items identified during the initial codebase review (May 2026). Ordered by priority within each tier.

### TQ-P1 — Fix before next PR merge

**TQ-1 — Restore coverage threshold** ✅
- Current global coverage is 74.62%, below the 90% statement/line threshold set in `package.json`
- Primary offenders: `tags.js` (32.78%), `api.js` (64.96%), `components.js` (5.83%)
- Add unit tests for all five functions in `components.js` directly (they are pure HTML-returning functions, easy to test)
- Do not lower the threshold — add tests or explicitly exclude files with a justification comment

**TQ-2 — Global error handler in `app.js`** — *quality check ✅*
- ✅ `errorHandler` middleware added to `middleware.js` and registered in `app.js`
- ✅ Production message redaction and `err.status`/`err.statusCode` chain implemented and tested

**TQ-2b — Protect async route handlers** — *quality check ✅*
- ✅ `wrapAsync` utility added to `middleware.js`; applied to all async route handlers across 10 route files
- ✅ 3 new tests added to `middleware.test.js` (happy path, rejection forwarding, integration with `errorHandler`)

### TQ-P2 — This sprint

**TQ-3 — Split `tags.js` (1,873 lines)** — *quality check ✅*
- ✅ Monolith deleted and replaced with `src/routes/tags/index.js`, `combinator.js`, `manage.js`, `recipes.js`
- ✅ `queries.js` data-access layer created for vocabulary and initial results fetching

**TQ-3b — Finish the tags module split (≤400 lines target)** — *quality check ✅*
- ✅ All raw `db.query` calls extracted from `manage.js` and `recipes.js` into `queries.js`
- ✅ `manage.js` (722 → 44 lines) split into `manageViews.js` + `manageScript.js`
- ✅ `recipes.js` (519 → 73 lines) split into `recipesViews.js`
- ✅ `combinator.js` (473 → 140 lines) render helpers → `combinatorViews.js`; inline script → `combinatorScript.js`
- ✅ 21 new tests for all extracted query functions

**TQ-4 — Integer coercion on all ID inputs** ✅
- `POST /albums/:id/access/add` and `POST /albums/:id/access/remove` pass `req.body.viewer_id` to queries without `parseInt`
- Add a guard at the top of each handler: `const viewerId = parseInt(req.body.viewer_id); if (!Number.isInteger(viewerId)) return res.status(400).send('Invalid id');`
- Apply the same pattern to any other route accepting numeric IDs from the request body

**TQ-5 — Standardise `resetAllMocks` across all test files** ✅
- Several test files use `jest.clearAllMocks()` — team convention is `jest.resetAllMocks()` to prevent `mockResolvedValueOnce` queue bleed
- Do a global find-and-replace in `src/__tests__/`; confirm no test starts relying on mock state leaking between `it()` blocks

### TQ-P3 — Backlog

**TQ-6 — Remove `unsafe-inline` from CSP**
- `app.js:18` sets `scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", ...]`, which largely negates XSS protection
- Move all inline `<script>` blocks to files served from `/public` (or use a nonce-based CSP)
- This unblocks a strict CSP: `scriptSrc: ["'self'"]`

**TQ-7 — Remove hardcoded credentials from `server.js`**
- `SEED_EMAIL` defaults to a developer's personal email; `SEED_PASS` defaults to `changeme`
- Require both via env vars (consistent with the `SESSION_SECRET` guard already present); fail fast with a clear error if missing in production (`NODE_ENV === 'production'`)

**TQ-8 — Lazy loading on photo wall**
- Replace the unbounded `SELECT *` in `GET /photos` with cursor-based pagination
- Add `GET /api/photos?cursor=<last_id>&limit=24` returning `{ photos: [], nextCursor: null | id }`
- Client-side: `IntersectionObserver` on a sentinel element at the bottom of the mosaic; on intersection, fetch next batch and append cells to the DOM
- Initial page load keeps SSR (first 24 photos rendered server-side, no flash)
- Ensure `ORDER BY p.created_at DESC, p.id DESC` for a stable cursor

**TQ-9 — Bulk insert refactor in `setTags`**
- `uploadHelpers.js:52-65` issues 2 queries per tag in a loop (N×2 round-trips)
- Replace with: one `INSERT INTO tags (name) SELECT unnest($1::text[]) … RETURNING id`, then one `INSERT INTO photo_tags … SELECT unnest($1::int[]), unnest($2::int[])`
- Critical for batch uploads (200 photos × 5 tags = 2,000 queries today)

**TQ-12 — Extract views from all route handlers (follow tags pattern)**
- `photos.js`, `albums.js`, `travels.js`, `map.js`, `timeline.js` mix SQL, auth logic, and HTML rendering in single handler functions
- Extract inline HTML into `*Views.js` and inline scripts into `*Script.js` modules, mirroring the split done for `tags/` in TQ-3b
- Target: route handlers contain only HTTP plumbing; view functions are independently testable

**TQ-13 — Move `canModify` to shared module**
- `canModify(session, entity)` is currently defined in `middleware.js` and only used in route handlers; it is a domain concept, not HTTP middleware
- Move to a shared `src/permissions.js` (or `src/auth.js`) module; re-export from `middleware.js` for backwards compatibility during migration
- Rationale: clearer layering — authorization logic belongs with business rules, not Express plumbing

**TQ-14 — Extract `filterOwnedPhotoIds` helper**
- Several route handlers (albums, photos) repeat the pattern of filtering a list of photo IDs down to those owned by the current user
- Extract to a shared helper function; cover with unit tests
- Reduces duplication and makes ownership checks easier to audit

**TQ-15 — Replace `setTags` loop with bulk UNNEST**
- `uploadHelpers.js:52-65` issues 2 queries per tag in a loop (N×2 round-trips)
- Replace with: one `INSERT INTO tags (name) SELECT unnest($1::text[]) … RETURNING id`, then one `INSERT INTO photo_tags … SELECT unnest($1::int[]), unnest($2::int[])`
- Critical for batch uploads (200 photos × 5 tags = 2,000 queries today); this is TQ-9 renamed with updated context

**TQ-16 — Move SQL queries to `queries.js` modules**
- Raw `db.query` calls are scattered throughout route handlers in `photos.js`, `albums.js`, `travels.js`, etc.
- Extract all DB access into per-route `queries.js` files (as done for `tags/queries.js` in TQ-3b)
- Enables unit testing of DB logic without HTTP overhead; prerequisite for TQ-11

### TQ-Long-term

**TQ-10 — Extract CSS from `layout.js` to a static file**
- `layout.js` is 1,582 lines, the majority of which is a CSS string inside a template literal
- Extract to `public/style.css`, serve via `express.static`; remove the `<style>` block from `page()`
- Enables browser caching, CSS linting, syntax highlighting, and smaller HTML payloads

**TQ-11 — Introduce a service/data-access layer**
- Route handlers currently mix SQL, file I/O, authorization, and HTML rendering in a single function
- Introduce `src/repositories/` (DB queries) and optionally `src/services/` (business logic) as separate modules
- Start with the most tested routes (`photos.js`, `albums.js`) to keep the refactor safe
- Target: route handlers contain only HTTP plumbing; business logic is independently unit-testable

**TQ-17 — Log (don't swallow) file deletion errors**
- `safeUnlink` and fire-and-forget `.catch(() => {})` calls silently discard unlink errors; orphaned files go unnoticed
- Replace empty catch blocks with `console.warn` at minimum; consider a structured log entry with the file path and error code
- Related to TR-8 in the travel page backlog

**TQ-18 — Unify UI language (pick EN or FR)**
- Mixed English/French labels exist in the UI (form labels, button text, error messages)
- Decide on one language and do a pass to make all user-facing strings consistent

**TQ-19 — Split `layout.js`**
- `layout.js` is ~2,000 lines: CSS string, nav HTML, page shell, location-search script, CSRF script, and `esc()` utility all in one file
- Split into: `src/layout/page.js` (shell + nav), `public/style.css` (extracted CSS — see TQ-10), `src/layout/esc.js` (utility)
- Supersedes TQ-10; doing both together avoids a second large refactor

## Dependencies

```
Phase 1 (MA schema)
  └── Phase 2 (ALB-1, RA-1)   ← needs album_photos table
  └── Phase 3 (DS-11/12/13)   ← independent, can start any time
  └── Phase 4 (AI-1, AI-2)    ← independent, can start any time
```

Recommended order: **1 → 2** (schema first, then UX), **3 + 4 in parallel** after phase 1.

---

## Risks

- **MA migration on live data**: the `album_id → album_photos` migration must be tested against a production DB dump before running. A photo in multiple albums is impossible pre-migration, so the migrate script is a straight copy (no ambiguity).
- **Viewer access query complexity**: joining `album_access → album_photos → photos` adds a join hop to every viewer-scoped query. Check query plans on large datasets.
- **Ollama availability**: AI features must degrade gracefully when Ollama is unreachable (show a clear error, never crash the app).
- **pHash false positives**: very similar but distinct photos (e.g. burst shots) will be flagged. The admin review step is essential — never auto-delete.
- **DS-13 rubber-band select**: browser drag behaviour conflicts with text selection and image dragging; will need `preventDefault` on mousedown and pointer capture.
